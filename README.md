Yet Another Productivity System

## Motivation
I have always had a ton of trouble with Todos, software being the one of them. Every software has an opinion, and they seem to do very well with a large part of the populace. But as usual, I tried to do it, and I failed. So instead of blaming myself about not completeing my to-dos, I figured I would try something to build myself, that meets my requirements. So I came up with YAPS(I am not good with names, sorry!) with the following principles:
- Treat the daily notes as a storage medium, in the GTD terminology, for open loops. Use nested todos if you have to, but only if you have to
- Use your daily notes as a guidance plan to move across your day
- At the end of the day, plan a shutdown ritual. I say to myself "I am done", and go for drinking some water. When I am return refreshed, I spend 5 minutes on a review. Add links to future dates at which the task you think should surface.
- Move the pending tasks to the next day
- Add a shame meter to a task that should have been completed that day but didn't (doesn't have a future date resurface) 
- If the shame meter surpasses a shame threshold, or a minimum number of days where tasks should be allowed to move forward, add it to archive.

Adding to archive makes sense to me, because it doesn't clutter my daily note, and if that task was enough for me to ignore for a week, then maybe it needs to get deleted ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
